README: DotComGame

The knowledge purpose of this game:
1. use java API. In this project I used the ArrayList extension to create a 2d board
2. creating separate files for each class and compiling them together to run the program
3. basic OOP/class structures. public vs. private. instance variables & methods.

How it works:
a 2d board is created and three objects (taking up three cells each) are placed randomly along the board. The user has to guess where the objects are using the grid coordinated (a1,b2,c3, etc..) until all of the objects are "killed" (each guess eliminates a piece)
